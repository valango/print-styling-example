# print-styling-example

How to create selectively applied print styles.

## Usage
```shell
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:8080/` on browser. Push PRINT PAGE for different pages (there are two) and watch for differences.

So far, I did not find a way to apply the `@page` rule selectively, though.

## Disclaimer
I am huge fan of svelte ant vite. Try to replace either or both of those in this project and see the results. ;)

Creating this project was super-quick: 
```
npm create --y vite@latest print-styling-example
cd print-styling-example
```
